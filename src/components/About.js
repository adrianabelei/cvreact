        <p className="about-item"> From legal consulting to coding…Along my professional career I always had to deal with complex problems and enjoyed analyzing them. While studying at Restart Network I rediscovered that complexity by studying algorithms and working with <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>CodeIgniter</strong> as framework. </p>
        <p className="about-item">As months went by new languages were introduced to me, such <strong>Javascript</strong> and new frameworks such as NodeJS and libraries and tools such as <strong>React, MongoDB  or GitHub</strong>. Through a lot of <strong>hard work </strong>and <strong>collaboration</strong> with other colleagues I have managed to have a good understanding of all these new technologies.</p> 
        <p className="about-item">I know this journey has just started and I am queen to continue learning and to improve my programming skills in order to become a very good developer. Moreover as personal goal I want to encourage all <strong>women</strong> to join this field so we have a more diverse and equal tech industry .
